# Top Down RPG Test

![TopDownRPG](screenshots/screen01.png)

This is just a test project I use for helping me teach some concepts.

* Top-down RPG (Zelda-like) framework, with movement and attack
* Enemies that can take damage and die
* Pseudo flashlight using a mesh that simulates shadows
  
There are depth issues that are Unity's fault (don't like how they support this type 
of maps, but haven't explored many solutions for that so far).
